However, Ethyl Mercaptan odorant is added to enable LPG leaks to be detected by smell</p></li><li><p>LPG vapour is transparent, but clouds usually appear as a white mist due to water vapour condensed in the air</p></li><li><p>LPG has a low viscosity, hence it has no lubricating properties and it is more likely to find a leakage path than water or most other petroleum products</p></li><li><p>These facts are significant with respect to the design of plant and have particular relevance to the glands and seals of pumps, compressors and valves</p></li><li><p>The cooling which occurs on evaporation of liquid LPG causes frost burns to the skin and damage to eyes if protection (gloves and goggles) is not available, and may cause ice formation on exposed equipment</p></li><li><p>LPG whether in liquid or vapour form, is only slightly toxic</p></li><li><p>The vapour is an asphyxiate and an anaesthetic, but only in high concentrations</p></li><li><p>Liquid LPG has a high coefficient of expansion.</p></li><li><p>Therefore LPG equipment must be provided with adequate ullage and or relief valves to prevent it becoming over-pressured as a result of temperature increases (e.g. due to heating in the sun)</p></li></ul>"
