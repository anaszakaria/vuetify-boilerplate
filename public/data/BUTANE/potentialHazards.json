In its refrigerated or liquefied form (below 0 °C), butane can cause cold burns</p></li><li><p>Butane has a low viscosity, hence it has no lubricating properties and it is more likely to find a leakage path than water or most other petroleum products</p></li><li><p>These facts are significant with respect to the design of plant and have particular relevance to the glands and seals of pumps, compressors and valves</p></li><li><p>Liquid butane has a high coefficient of expansion</p></li><li><p>Therefore equipment containing butane must be provided with adequate ullage and or relief valves to prevent it becoming over-pressured as a result of temperature increases</p></li></ul>"
